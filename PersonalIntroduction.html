        <p>Favorite culture that I am not native to is the Irish. 
            Ireland has beautiful rolling green hills, 
            and has the largest population of natural red heads per capita. 
            Ireland is also home to one of the oldest lighthouses that is still in operation.</p>
        <p>Abraham Lincoln, because of his abolishment of slavery.
            Charles Darwin, because of his contributions to biology and psychology.
